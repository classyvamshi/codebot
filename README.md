This is a Python code for creating a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Streamlit, a web application framework for creating interactive data-driven applications.

The chatbot is designed to answer questions related to water conservation. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to user queries. The user types their question or message into a text input box, and the chatbot responds with a text message generated by GPT-3.

The code defines a function to generate OpenAI's response, which takes the user input as a prompt and returns a response generated by the GPT-3 model. The main() function sets up the Streamlit application, creates a text input box for the user, and displays the chatbot's responses in a text area.

To use this code, you need to have an OpenAI API key and replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key. You can also customize the chatbot's behavior by adjusting the parameters of the OpenAI.Completion.create() function, such as the temperature, max_tokens, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty.
